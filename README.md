# OBGiveAll /!\ WIP /!\

**OBGiveAll** is a plugin to make giveall easier.  
It permits the creation of kits that can only be redeemed if the player was present at the time of the giveall.


## Why use OBGiveAll ?
**OBGiveAll** is designed to be used for events. It provides the possibility to give a reward to a specific player or every players connected that can then redeemed in an interface.

The redeeming of the rewards by the players can be done at any given time as long as they are eligible for a reward.
